    <h2>Windows</h2>
    <p>
        The Windows OS has been around since the 1980s and has had several versions and updates (including Windows 95,
        Windows Vista, Windows 7/8/10, etc.)
        Microsoft Windows is one of the popular operating system types and is preloaded on most new PC hardware.
        With each new Windows update or release, Microsoft continues to work on improving their users’ experience, hardware, and software,
        making Windows more accessible and easier to use.
    <p>

    <p>
        Microsoft Windows contains a control panel, a desktop and desktop assistant, disk cleanup, event viewer, and more. Many users prefer Microsoft Windows because they say it’s compatible with many other kinds of software. Many kinds of computer programs run best on Microsoft Windows because they’re developed by Microsoft.

        Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems designed by Microsoft Corporation and primarily targeted to Intel architecture based computers, with an estimated 88.9 percent total usage share on Web connected computers.[21][25][26][27] The latest version is Windows 10.
        In 2011, Windows 7 overtook Windows XP as most common version in use.[28][29][30]

        Microsoft Windows was first released in 1985, as an operating environment running on top of MS-DOS, which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time. In 1995, Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstrap. For backwards compatibility, Win9x could run real-mode MS-DOS[31][32] and 16-bit Windows 3.x[33] drivers. Windows ME, released in 2000, was the last version in the Win9x family. Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel. Current client versions of Windows run on IA-32, x86-64 and 32-bit ARM microprocessors.[34] In addition Itanium is still supported in older server version Windows Server 2008 R2. In the past, Windows NT supported additional architectures.
        Server editions of Windows are widely used. In recent years, Microsoft has expended significant capital in an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system. However, Windows' usage on servers is not as widespread as on personal computers as Windows competes against Linux and BSD for server market share.[35][36]
